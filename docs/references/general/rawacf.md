# RAWACF files 

RAWACF files are raw files produced at radar sites. 

Sometimes they are post-processed from IQDAT files or converted from the older-format dat files (see `dattorawacf`).

## Naming Convention

The community standard for naming RAWACF files is:

> YYYYMMDD.HH.mm.ss.<3-letter radar code>.[a-d].rawacf

The field [a-d] is used when the data have been separated into multiple files based on a particular operating parameter (e.g. frequency, beam pattern, control program). This field may not be used if all the available data are provided in a single file.
